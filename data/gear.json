If [they] fail or do not have room to fire it, the flare still ignites, but it but does not travel into the air. Instead, it remains at ground level, illuminating an area out to short range. Whether [they] succeed or fail, the flare's illumination continues for five rounds, after which time it burns out. Though luma flares are not designed as weapons, creative characters can nonetheless use them as such. They are extremely hard to aim, but the mere prospect of being struck by one will cause many foes to reconsider attacking. They have the following profile as a weapon: luma flare (Gunnery; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range-Long; Blast 4, Burn 4, Disorient 2, Inaccurate 2, Prepare 2, Limited Ammo 1)."

When applied to droids, emergency repair patches heal 3 wounds, and up to five patches can be used in a single day. Using a sixth emergency repair patch has no effect; by that point, the droid is so patched and jury-rigged together that further patches would be useless.
