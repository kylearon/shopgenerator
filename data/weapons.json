Targets hit with a glop grenade must make an Easy (1 Difficulty) Coordination Check to keep the foam from filling their breathing passages.

This requires an Easy (1 Difficulty) Ranged - Light Check to complete. Failure on the check indicates that the foam has been ruined, and any net Threat result means that some mishap occurs and the user is engulfed in quickly hardening goo. This requires the user to make an Easy (1 Difficulty) Coordination Check to avoid getting the goo in their nose or mouth per the rules above.

Though devastating to droids and cybernetics, the ion blast doesn’t harm living tissue. Due to the compact size of the energy cell and the large power requirements of the weapon, the Droid Disabler can only be fired a few times before the energy pack needs to be replaced. "
