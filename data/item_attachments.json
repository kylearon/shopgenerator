The difficulty of this check can be reduced by 1 with a successful Knowledge (Xenology) check. If successful, the XV-09 grants two boost dice to any Survival checks made to control the beast wearing the harness. In addition, creatures that are successfully pacified gain a boost die to any Discipline checks. Game Masters can spend any threat result generated by the initial Survival check to reflect one or more negative side effects caused by the drugs. In addition, the Game Master can spend three threat results or a despair result to reflect a catastrophic reaction to the drugs, such as a heart attack or brain aneurysm, which results in the animal's death. While safe for use on animals, the powerful mixture of chemicals in the harness can be dangerous to the minds of sentient beings.
